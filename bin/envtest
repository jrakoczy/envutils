        OPERANDS:
            <target> — either a file or a directory; if it's a directory
                       all its content will be sym-linked recursively.
            <links> — either a link name or a directory where all links
                       reside.

        DESCRIPTION:
            Inteligentlly sym-links <links> to <target>. If the <links>
            operand is not present, it's inferred from <target>.
            If <target> is inside a Git directory, then this directory is
            treated as a sym-linking root — its path is replaced with
            \$HOME during the linking process. This allows you to
            convenietly test your dot-files that are kept in a separate Git directory.

        OPTIONS:
            -h
            -i — do not test whether the <target> path is within a Git directory.

        EXAMPLES:

            The content of <target> is sym-linked directly from within
            /absolute/links-directory (it doesn't matter whether <target>
            is within a Git directory):

                envtest /absolute/target-directory /absolute/links-directory


            <target> is directory in a non-Git directory. In such case
            its content is symlinked from wihtin \$HOME/target-directory.

                envtest /absolute/path/target-directory

            <target> is a regular file in a non-Git directory. It's
            sym-linked to \$HOME/source-file:

                envtest relative/source-file

            <target> is a directory in a non-Git directory. Its content is
            sym-linked from within \$HOME/relative/target-directory:

                envtest relatve/target-directory

            <target> is a directory in a Git directory. Let's assume the
            <target> absoulte path is
            /git-directory/foo/relative/target-directory. In such case all
            its content is sym-linked from within $HOME/foo/relative/source-
            directory:

                envtest relative/target-directory

            The same applies to absolute paths that point to a file or a
            directory in a Git directory. The content of <target> is sym-
            linked from within \$HOME/foo/target-directory:

                envtest /absolute/git-directory/foo/target-directory
        "
